# granatus-slow-the-glitch

This is a route for the Breath of the Wild 100% speedrun, based on the original "Granatus" route by Johnnyboomr and updated and worked on by the speedrun community. It includes updates related to the major glitches: transmutation, IST and DIC.

This version has been modified for using standard movements (no movement-based glitches such as windbomb, BLSS, or BTB). The route is intended to prioritize the reduction of difficulty, and makes the following assumptions:
- Transmutation, IST and DIC will be used.
- At least two giant ancient cores will be obtained so that an ancient bow and ancient shield can be purchased.
- Hylian Shield durability will be transferred to the ancient shield.
- Wood, Ancient, Shock and Bomb arrows are the ones to be maximized.
- Epona will be used.

The fury and gale routing is at the runner's discression. The originial routing that was in Tao's document was used, however, the runner can easily change the priority of which enemies to use it on. There will normally be plenty of time for the 12 min rechrage. For example, I use it on backside-gem talus (rather than bomb arrows), and use the Boulder Breaker for all other talus.
